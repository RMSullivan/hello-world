Hello-
<br/>
I have a creative, entrepreneurial spirit and am a lover of sweets & hoarder of fonts. I have been happily married for fourteen years and currently work as a creative director for an e-commerce furniture company. I occasionally work with small businesses as a consultant doing brand strategy, art direction, and marketing. I am currently a full-time student pursuing a bachelor's degree in web development.
